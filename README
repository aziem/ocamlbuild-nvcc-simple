Tiny example showing how to call nvcc CUDA compiler using ocamlbuild.

At the moment it does not work out dependencies: my use case is to
compile a single *.cu file to an object file to be statically linked
with OCaml program to run code on a GPU. The plugin could be made more
elaborate to handle dependencies etc.
